    <h5 class="card-title">United States of America </h5>
    <p class="card-text">
      The United States had a total of 11,613 hate crimes in 2022, according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Hate crime is defined by the Oxford Dictionary as "a crime, typically one involving violence, that is motivated by prejudice on the basis of ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, or similar grounds." The United States dictates that if a crime committed has been fueled with prejudice precursors then said offence could be deemed as a hate crime. Hate crimes do not only violate the victim, but also the community to which the victim belongs.
